# netrunner-apt-config

Default setup for apt repositories and apt pinning. 

This includes the various different repositories we use by default in Netrunner stored in **etc/apt/sources.list.d/** 
and their pinning (if necessary) in **etc/apt/preferences.d** aswell as their gpg keys for authentication/verification 
in **etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/**
